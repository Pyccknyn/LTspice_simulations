## Overview

This repository contains LTspice `.asc` schematics and simulation setups developed for both academic projects and personal experimentation. Each simulation focuses on a different aspect of circuit analysis, from switch-mode power conversion to high-speed analog behavior and digital-like comparator action.

## Simulations

### Buck Converter Analysis

- **Objective:** Design and analyze a synchronous buck converter with PWM control.
- **Simulations:**
  - Transient analysis of startup, steady-state switching waveforms, and load-step response
  - `.step` parameter sweeps of duty cycle, inductor value, and load resistance to evaluate output ripple and efficiency

### Operational Amplifier Circuits

- **Objective:** Implement and characterize inverting and non-inverting amplifier topologies.
- **Simulations:**
  - AC Bode plots for active high-pass and low-pass filter variants
  - Transient step response to measure slew rate, settling time, and overshoot
  - Worst case runs with `.step` and `.tran` directives to assess gain tolerance

### Comparator Circuits

- **Objective:** Model a fast comparator with hysteresis (Schmitt trigger) characteristics.
- **Simulations:**
  - Transient analysis of input step transitions to measure propagation delay and switching thresholds
  - Parameter sweep of positive feedback resistor values to tune hysteresis window
  - Behavioral source for programmable reference voltage and noise injection
